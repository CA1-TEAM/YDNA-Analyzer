While automating tasks significantly improves efficiency and saves time, security must always remain a top priority. Automation scripts, if not properly secured, can become a vector for malware or unauthorized modifications. By implementing measures like path validation, file integrity checks, and robust error handling, we can minimize the risks associated with script automation. Preventing maliciously inducted script malware is not just a precautionâ€”it's a necessity to safeguard systems and data.
