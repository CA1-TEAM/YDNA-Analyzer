DNA-Analyzer

Overview
The YDNA-Analyzer is a standalone Python tool for analyzing Y-DNA data. It allows users to visualize Y-DNA patterns through scatter plots, providing insights into genealogical connections, haplogroup trends, and DNA relationships.

Features

Scatter Plots: Visualize SNP vs. STR data with color-coded haplogroups.
Standalone Tool: 
Easy to Use: Load Y-DNA data from a CSV file and analyze it with simple commands.
Installation
To use the YDNA-Analyzer, follow these steps:

Download the Tool:

Visit the YDNA-Analyzer GitHub repository.
Click the green Code button and select Download ZIP.
Extract the Files:

Unzip the downloaded file to access the tool files.
Install Dependencies:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the extracted folder and install the required Python libraries:
pip install pandas matplotlib
Usage
Follow these steps to analyze your Y-DNA data:

Prepare Your Data:

Create a CSV file containing your Y-DNA data with the following structure:
SNP,STR,Haplogroup
12,20,A
15,23,B
17,22,A
14,25,C
16,21,B
Run the Tool:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the ydna_analyzer.py file.
Run the script:
python ydna_analyzer.py
Provide the Path to Your CSV File:

When prompted, enter the path to your Y-DNA CSV file.
Example:
Enter the path to your Y-DNA CSV file: test_data.csv
View the Results:

A scatter plot will be generated, showing SNP (x-axis) vs. STR (y-axis) with haplogroups color-coded.
Requirements

Python 3.6 or Later: Ensure Python is installed on your system. Download it from python.org.

Dependencies:
pandas: For data manipulation.
matplotlib: For data visualization.
